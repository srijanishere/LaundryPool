# LaundryPool
LaundryPool is a web-based service which connects between the customer and a laundry to smoothly pick-up/deliver clothes as well provide a live tracking of the order.

# What does it do?
It lets you connect to your nearby laundry stores and lets you select one that you please, thereby providing you the facility to book any of their services through LanudryPool and the rest will be taken cared by us. Pick-up, delivery, tracking, you name it.
